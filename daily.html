        <h2>THOR ODINSON</h2>
        <P>"Thor is the "God of Thunder",a member of the race known as
            <br> the Asgardians, a group of humanoid beings from the <br> pocket dimension of Asgard, the Realm Eternal. Thor is the son of Odin,<br> the All-Father and king of Asgard. He was worshiped by the humans known <br> as Vikings and became part
            of Norse Mythology. Armed with his enchanted <br> Uru hammer Mjolnir, which helps him to channel his godly energies, he became <br> the mightiest warrior in the Ten Realms. When his irresponsible and impetuous <br> behavior became too much,
            Odin sent him to Midgard (more commonly known as Earth)<br> as a disabled mortal medical student named Donald Blake,<br> stripped of his memory. After learning humility he regained his memory as well as his godly <br> powers. Thor went on
            to become a champion for Midgard as well as one of the founding <br> members of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".
